# Fizzbuzz

## General Description

Fizzbuzz is a game that returns a different output depending on the number that is passed in.
This is the second incarnation of the Makers Academy Pre-Course Fizzbuzz Challenge.
This program is written to pass differen't TDD tests to the [Fizzbuzz_2](https://github.com/LewisYoul/Fizzbuzz_2) challenge.
Both [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/LewisYoul/fizzbuzz) and [Fizzbuzz_2](https://github.com/LewisYoul/Fizzbuzz_2) are my first programs written using Test Driven Development (TDD), collaborated on with [Jamie LeMercier](https://github.com/ethicalDev).

#### Rules

* Returns 'fizz' if the number passed is a multiple of 3 only.
* Returns 'buzz' if the number passed is a multiple of 5 only.
* Returns 'fizzbuzz' if the number passed is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
* Returns the number passed in if it is none of the above.
